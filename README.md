# Front Peek Logger

Front Peek is a Client-Only Persistent Logger, it helps you to store application state and activity logs directly on the client and retrieve this logs later to analysis and debug. This mitigates the needing of a robust backend platform to receive and process all the client activity, since all the data is decentralized and stored on client itself. Note: this is a `Debug Tool`, very similar to when your Operational System collects data about a crash or usabillity and suggests you to send them to the responsible team; this is NOT a tracker, health checker, observability or live activity analysis tool.
